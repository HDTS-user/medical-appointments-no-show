# medical-appointments-no-show
Medical appointment no-shows are a significant issue in the healthcare system. When a patient is not able to keep his/her appointment and fails to notify the clinic, the clinic doesnâ€™t have the opportunity to book another patient in the same slot. This may mean the loss of an opportunity for another patient to get served. The medical appointment no-show prediction leverages data analytics and patient behavior insights to predict if the patient is at a higher risk of missing their scheduled medical appointments. By identifying these potential no-shows in advance, healthcare providers can proactively take measures such as sending reminders or adjusting their schedules to reduce disruptions, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient attendance rates.

## Highlights
1. This solution uses the data sourced from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to leverage various features related to demographics, health, and behavioral aspects of the patient to predict the risk of no-shows. The algorithm has been tuned to be robust to specific features to allow it to generalize over a large number of scenarios.
2. This solution can be leveraged in various settings of healthcare providers like clinics, hospital outpatient departments, dialysis centers, etc to facilitate better management of their limited resources.
